Welcome to Treasure Hunt Tactics – a strategic grid-based game where every move counts!
Your goal? Find all the hidden treasures without falling into traps, and do it before you run out of turns!

Controls:
  - Arrow Keys (↑ ↓ ← →) – Move your player up, down, left, or right.
  - H Key (H) – Use a hint to locate the nearest treasure (limited to 3 hints per game).
  - Close Window or Press Esc – To exit the game.
Game Rules:
 1.	Grid Size: The game is played on a 10x10 grid.
 2.	Start Point: You always start from the top-left corner (0,0).
 3.	Treasures:
  - There are 5 treasures hidden on the grid.
  - Stepping on a treasure gives you +1 score.
 4.	Traps:
  -	There are 7 traps scattered randomly.
  -	If you land on one, you’re teleported back to the start.
 5.	Turns: You have a total of 30 turns to collect all treasures.
 6.	Hints:
  -	You get 3 hints per game.
  -	Each hint tells you how far (rows and columns) the nearest unrevealed treasure is.
 7.	AI Brain: The game uses Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to calculate the smartest move paths under the hood – but you're still in control unless AI automation is enabled.
 8.	Winning: Collect all treasures before you run out of turns!
 9.	Losing: Game ends if you run out of turns – your final score is shown in the console.
